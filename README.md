# radialrect_project

This project came about during my time at GTRI where a need was discovered to collect data points as efficiently as possible.

This script was later turned into a method where some parameters were passed in and the output was an array of points in order of TSP nearest neighbor from the center to optimize the path length efficicieny of the traveling antenna.
