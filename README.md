# radialrect_project

This project came about during my time at GTRI where a need was discovered to collect data points as efficiently as possible. The idea was that the more important information was nearer the center of the two dimension cross section (X and Y in this case). Therefore, greater measurement density would be found closer to the center with some measurements still occuring in the outskirts.

This script was later turned into a method where some parameters were passed in and the output was an array of points in order of TSP nearest neighbor from the center to optimize the path length efficicieny of the traveling antenna. This is hard to explain, you had to be there lol
